## SCAD Drawings

This directory contains such SCAD drawings as can be used to create a case
using [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org).  There's also an [STL](arrowzip.stl)
file, also generated by [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org), that you can use
with your printer if you don't want to generate it yourself using
[OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org).

Use them at your own risk, as my first version tore the buttons off of the side
of my board.
